# Prime Game

## Description
In this game, Maria and Ben take turns picking prime numbers from a set of consecutive integers starting from 1 up to `n`. Each player removes the chosen prime number and its multiples. The player who cannot make a move loses the game.

The function `isWinner(x, nums)` is used to determine the winner of multiple rounds, where `x` is the number of rounds and `nums` is an array of integers. The player with the most wins is returned.
